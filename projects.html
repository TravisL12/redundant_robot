			Redundant Robot <a href='https://github.com/travisl12' target='_blank'>is a little site I built</a> that, for several years,
			has mainly been home to my SheepShaver tutorial. Since becoming a <a href='/travis_lawrence_resume.pdf'>web developer</a> 
			I like to hack away on some of my ideas and post them here for people to check out. Feel free to give a shout out 
			on <a href='https://twitter.com/travisl12'>twitter</a>, and if you're curious, you can learn <a href='/about.html'>more about me!</a>

			<h4>SHEEPSHAVER TUTORIAL</h4>
			<p>
				I wrote this Mac OS emulator tutorial in 2008 during a serious bout of graduate school procrastination. 
				It offers up some ROMs that I have collected over the years and I do my best to help out people that who have questions.

			<h4>ASTRONOMY PICTURE OF THE DAY (APOD) CHROME EXTENSION</h4>
			<p>
				This is a Chrome extension that replaces your new tab screen with a random APOD image.
				There are multiple key commands and buttons available for selecting another random
				image or to view todays picture. I am a big fan of all things outer space and I've had the APOD
				as my home page for years.

			<h4>BUILD GUITAR TABS</h4>
			<p>
				I learned to play guitar using guitar tabs of popular songs but I was never inspired to write out songs
				in tablature due to having to format .txt files. I wrote this basic guitar tablature writer that allows quick
				entry of chords, notes and lyrics, then creates the .txt file for you.

			<h4>KEY-IANO</h4>
			<p>
				A close friend of mine wanted to learn to play piano by mapping piano keys to the keyboard. So I built out this keyboard-piano (key-iano)
				that plays most notes of the middle range of a piano. Sort of an unfinished demo.

			<h4>DIGITAL CLOCK</h4>
			<p>
				This was a clock I made using only <tt>&lt;divs&gt;</tt> and CSS (with a little JS). The background changes color according to the hex color value it represents.
