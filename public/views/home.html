	<p>Redundant Robot <a href='https://github.com/travisl12' target='_blank'>is a little site I built</a> that, for several years,
	has mainly been home to my SheepShaver tutorial. Since becoming a <a href='/travis_lawrence_resume.pdf'>web developer</a> 
	I like to hack away on some of my ideas and post them here for people to check out. Feel free to give a shout out 
	on <a href='https://twitter.com/travisl12'>twitter</a>, and if you're curious, you can learn <a ui-sref='redundant.about'>more about me!</a></p>

			<h4>SheepShaver Tutorial</h4>
			<p>I wrote this Mac OS emulator tutorial in 2008 during a serious bout of graduate school procrastination. 
			It offers up some ROMs that I have collected over the years and I do my best to help out people that who have questions.</p>

			<h4>Build guitar tabs</h4>
			<p>I learned to play guitar using guitar tabs of popular songs but I was never inspired to write out songs
			in tablature due to having to format .txt files. I wrote this basic guitar tablature writer that allows quick
			entry of chords, notes and lyrics, then creates the .txt file for you.</p>

			<h4>Key-iano</h4>
			<p>A close friend of mine wanted to learn to play piano by mapping piano keys to the keyboard. So I built out this keyboard-piano (key-iano)
			that plays most notes of the middle range of a piano. Sort of an unfinished demo.</p>

			<h4>Digital Clock</h4>
			<p>This was a clock I made using only <tt>&lt;divs&gt;</tt> and CSS (with a little JS). The background changes color according to the hex color value it represents.</p>
