	I have become a <a href='/travis_lawrence_resume.pdf'>web developer</a> and when I get some spare time I like to hack away on 
	simple little ideas that either I, or friends, think up. Feel free to give a shout out on <a href='https://twitter.com/travisl12'>twitter</a>,

			<h4>SheepShaver Tutorial</h4>
			<p>I wrote this Mac OS emulator tutorial in 2008 during a serious bout of graduate school procrastination. 
			It offers up some ROMs that I have collected over the years and I do my best to help out people that are in need of some help.</p>

			<h4>Personal Spending Tracker</h4>
			<p>This is a recreation of a monstrous spending spreadsheet I used to keep meticulous records with. Outside of having graphs everywhere
			I have spent a decent amount of time making this little app to efficinet handle the 10+ years of spending records that I have accrued.
			Spending data is sourced via a Google Doc.</p>

			<h4>Build guitar tabs</h4>
			<p>Like many people, I learned to play guitar using guitar tabs of popular songs. Though I was never inspired to write out songs
			in tablature simply due to having to format .txt files. I wrote this basic guitar tablature writer that operates by allow you quick
			entry of chords, notes and lyrics, then creates the .txt file for you.</p>

			<h4>Key-iano</h4>
			<p>A close friend of mine wanted to learn to play piano by mapping piano keys to the keyboard. So I built out this keyboard-piano (key-iano)
			that plays most notes of the middle range of a piano. Sort of an unfinished demo.</p>

			<h4>Digital Clock</h4>
			<p>This was a clock I made using only <tt>&lt;divs&gt;</tt> and CSS (with a little JS). The background changes color according to the hex color value it represents.</p>
