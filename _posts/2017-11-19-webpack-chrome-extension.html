      Earlier this year I released my first Chrome Extension that replaces the new tab page with the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD). Initially I built the extension
      as both something that I wanted to use, and as an exercise in how to build a chrome extension. It's a pretty simple HTML page with some JS and CSS mixed in, nothing
      groundbreaking, but I was happy with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I built several features that I thought were particularly fun, all the while doing my best to keep things object oriented. But the amount of variables that were
      in the global scope always irked me. I knew better than to be sharing instantiated objects so broadly in the global scope but I was being a little lazy and
      it wasn't that big of a deal.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally I got to a point where if I wanted to continue building out features and making refactoring easier, I knew I needed to get a modern build flow going.
      I decided to use Webpack and Babel, both because I was just learning how to use these tools at <a href='https://www.tumblr.com' target="_blank">work</a>,
      as well as a continued learning experience.
    </p>

    <h3>Beginning the Conversion to Webpack</h3>

    <p>
      Webpack an Babel have become popular lately for front end build tools, but they also have a reputation of being unneccessarily difficult in regards to
      their configuration and bootstrapping process. There certainly are plenty of tutorials available these days to walk you through this process but the speed
      of development of these tools these days can quickly out date tutorials and/or you can't find the right tutorial for specifically what you're tryig to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      For my specific case, I wasn't using React or Redux and so I just needed something to help build my project and allow me some of the nicer features of ES6
      (mainly `import` of dependencies).
    </p>

    <h3>Getting Started</h3>

    <p>
      Recently <a href='https://yarnpkg.com/en/'>Yarn</a> has become more widely used and thus I went with that for dependency management. I installed it using
      `homebrew` which is simply:</p>
      {% highlight bash %}
brew install yarn
      {% endhighlight %}
      
      <p>
        After that was completed I started my new project and began the bootstrapping of the project by adding Webpack; 
      </p>

      {% highlight bash %}
yarn add webpack webpack-dev-server path html-webpack-plugin extract-text-webpack-plugin

yarn add copy-webpack-plugin --dev
      {% endhighlight %}

      <p>
        I followed this up by adding in my CSS loaders, in which I'm using SASS to compile my stylesheets.
      </p>

      {% highlight bash %}
yarn add css-loader sass-loader style-loader
      {% endhighlight %}

      <p>
        And then followed that up with Babel
      </p>

      {% highlight bash %}
yarn add webpack babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-es2015 --dev
      {% endhighlight %}

      <p>
        I then added my `.babelrc` config file to set my presets:
      </p>

      {% highlight javascript %}
{
  "presets":[
    "es2015"
  ]
}
      {% endhighlight %}

      <p>
        
      </p>
